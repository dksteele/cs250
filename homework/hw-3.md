### Homework 3<br>

#### UDP Client in C

The outcome of this homework will be a functional echo client that sends messages to the echo-server (provided in this repository). This will require you to properly implement a simple UDP socket, process runtime arguments to the client, and capture responses from the server.

The user will supply the IP address and port to connect to at client runtime.

Be sure to:<br><br>
1. Output status to the user (e.g. message sent)<br>
2. Handle replies from the server<br>
3. Print the reply to screen
